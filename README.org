* Bolas
Bolas is a mtg card-fetcher discord bot that is heavily inspired by [[https://github.com/alexgerst/yawgmoth][yawgmoth.]] I am using this project as a way to try out some new approaches to api wrappers and plugin systems, so the way some parts of the bot are implemented are a bit esoteric.
* Structure
The core of the bot is located in bot.py, all simple commands such as !pingme should go in =commands.py=. More advanced functionality such as the card fetcher should be developed in =card_hooks.py=. Those files contain the base class that the plugins should be derived from.

The plugins are loaded through a metaclass called PluginMount. Every class derived from PluginMount will be automatically loaded and added to either the =self.chat_hook= or =self.commands= variables.

The docstring for each one of the plugins are all concatenated together and can be displayed with the hardcoded "!help" command.
* Example run file
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from src import bot

token = ""
# Assuming that the file just contains the token and nothing else
with open("secret_token.txt") as f:
    token = f.read()

bot = bot.Bolas(token)
bot.run(bot.token)

#+END_SRC
